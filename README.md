ðŸ“ˆ More than cross-platform Octave process wrapper ðŸ”¬

> Library is in an early stage and may not be suitable for rocket physics

## Motivation

Octave (and/or matlab) has excellent library of ready to use components and lets us write simpler code for solving complex
mathematical problems. This library is an attempt to bridge Octave and .NET worlds in a user-friendly and cross-platform manner while keeping 
single code-base and clean interface.

## Installation

  PM> `Install-Package Octave.NET`

## Usage

- Check the 'examples' folder
